# multiroom-audio

multiroom-audio is a project to bring a simple and cost effective solution that allows to stream audio from different sources to different devices located in different rooms. I built this solution mostly based on existing projects (such as: LMS or picoreplayer) to implement a multi room audio solution for my own home.
